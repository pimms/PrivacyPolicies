# SHUFPOD PRIVACY POLICY

ShufPod does not gather any information that can be used to identify you in any way.

Some usage data might be collected for analytical purposes, including:
 - Interactions within the app (page-views, usage of filters, playback etc)
 - Crash reports

I want to know who you are or what you do just as little as you want me to know it. Anonymous data can build a surprisingly strong profile about an individual, and I think it's just as creepy as you do.
